## üöÄ Local Setup

To run this website on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Download the files:**
    * `index.html`
    * (Optional) Create a `styles.css` file if you choose to separate the CSS.

2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    * Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
    * Double-click on `index.html`, and it will open in your default web browser.

No special servers or build tools are required to view the page.

## üìÇ File Structure

The project is contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
```

For better organization, you can separate the CSS:

1.  Create a file named `styles.css`.
2.  Move all the CSS rules from the `<style>` tags in `index.html` into `styles.css`.
3.  Link the stylesheet in `index.html` by adding `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` in the `<head>` section.

The structure would then be:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
```

## üé® Customization

This template is designed to be easily customized.

### Changing Text Content
